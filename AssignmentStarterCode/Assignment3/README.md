# Assignment 3 Starter Code

## Grid Image Maker Usage

### Terminal

```
gradle runServer
```

```
gradle runClient
```

## GUI Usage

### Code

1. Create an instance of the GUI

   ```
   ClientGui main = new ClientGui();
   ```

2. Create a new game and give it a grid dimension

   ```
   // the pineapple example is 2, but choose whatever dimension of grid you want
   // you can change the dimension to see how the grid changes size
   main.newGame(2); 
   ```

*Depending on how you want to run the system, 3 and 4 can be run how you want*

3. Insert image

   ```
   // the filename is the path to an image
   // the first coordinate(0) is the row to insert in to
   // the second coordinate(1) is the column to insert in to
   // you can change coordinates to see the image move around the box
   main.insertImage("img/Pineapple-Upside-down-cake_0_1.jpg", 0, 1);
   ```

4. Show GUI

   ```
   // true makes the dialog modal meaning that all interaction allowed is 
   //   in the windows methods.
   // false makes the dialog a pop-up which allows the background program 
   //   that spawned it to continue and process in the background.
   main.show(true);
   ```

   * newGame(int dimension) :  Start a new game with a grid of dimension x dimension size
   * insertImage(String filename, int row, int col) :  Inserts an image into the grid, this is when you know the file name, use the PicturePanel insertImage if you have a ByteStream
   * appendOutput(String message) :  Appends text to the output panel
   * submitClicked() :  Button handler for the submit button in the output panel
